## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 10! all the tests pass but one, as one of them checks for the old eslint format and not the new one, and i'm too lazy to change that test so it matches with the new format lol

## Self-Reflection:
i really liked this assignment. i love testing. it's probably because i have autism.

### How long it took me to finish this?
couple hours
